# Dark Sky Weather

Get weather info using Dark Sky. The current implementation retrieves the current weather information. To get it working
create a new device and specify the api key and the coordinates you want to use. The devices are updated every two minutes just to be sure
to not overload the server / key usage.


# Changelog
